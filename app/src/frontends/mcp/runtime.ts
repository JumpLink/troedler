/**
 * MCP server lifecycle for a gjsify/GJS process: the read-only gate and the stdio serve loop.
 *
 * COPIED VERBATIM from postbote (`projects/mail/app/src/frontends/mcp/runtime.ts`), which carries
 * it as an extraction candidate for a future `@gjsify/mcp`. **This is the second copy, and the
 * second copy is where you lift** — the duplication rule now applies, and the drift this file can
 * develop would fail in a consumer while the owning project stays green. Extracting it costs a
 * manual npm first-publish plus a release cut, so it is planned rather than done; until then, a
 * change here must be made in both copies or in neither.
 *
 * Keep it troedler-free — no import from anywhere else in this repo — so it can still move
 * verbatim.
 *
 * Both halves below are the surviving version of a mistake. Neither is a style preference; read
 * the comments before changing either one.

 * Gate mutating tools, DEFAULT-DENY.
 *
 * Unless writes are explicitly allowed, a tool is registered ONLY if it proves it is read-only
 * (`readOnlyHint === true`). A tool that omits the annotation, or mis-sets it, is DROPPED.
 *
 * The direction matters and is the whole point: the obvious spelling — drop only when
 * `readOnlyHint === false` — fails OPEN, silently exposing every tool whose author forgot the
 * annotation. This one fails CLOSED: the failure mode is a tool mysteriously missing from
 * `tools/list`, which gets noticed and fixed, instead of a mutation quietly reachable.
 *
 * Identifying tools by their own annotation rather than a name list means there is no second
 * list to drift as tools are added.
 *
 * Call this BEFORE registering anything — it wraps `registerTool`, so tools registered earlier
 * are already through.

/**
 * Serve over stdio until the client goes away, then exit the process.
 *
 * Park until EOF — NOT forever. The naive `await new Promise<never>(() => {})` is unsettleable,
 * so a server whose client died just keeps running. The evidence that this actually happens is
 * the parent pointer: such processes have been found REPARENTED TO `systemd --user`, which only
 * occurs once the process that spawned them is gone. A live client holds the write end of the
 * pipe open, so without EOF handling the process can only ever be reaped by hand.
 *
 * Do NOT treat concurrently-running servers as leaks: several editor sessions can be open at
 * once and each legitimately owns one. The liveness test is whether a process still has a live
 * client ancestor — not whether it belongs to the session doing the counting. Getting that
 * backwards kills healthy servers out from under parallel sessions.
 *
 * stdin EOF is the signal: for a stdio child, the parent closing the pipe IS "you are done".
 * The MCP SDK will not report it — its StdioServerTransport attaches only `data` and `error` to
 * stdin and calls `close()` solely on an explicit shutdown, so EOF is left to the server author.
